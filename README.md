<h1>Allergy Compass App</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The Allergy Compass App was developed as part of an intensive three-week block seminar. It allows users to manage their allergies and receive instant feedback on food choices via a chat feature. Currently, user data is stored locally with a history log.</p>

<h2>Current Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>User Registration:</strong> Users can create a local profile.</li>
    <li><strong>Allergy Selection:</strong> Users choose their allergies.</li>
    <li><strong>Food Compatibility Check:</strong> Via chat, users can inquire about food items; the app responds with whether it's safe based on allergies.</li>
    <li><strong>History:</strong> Logs all user interactions and food queries.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Multi-User Support:</strong> Allow multiple users to register and manage profiles.</li>
    <li><strong>Database Integration:</strong> Retrieve allergy and food data from a centralized database.</li>
    <li><strong>Emergency Response:</strong> Provide instructions on what to do and whom to contact if an allergen is consumed.</li>
    <li><strong>Symptom Analysis:</strong> Utilize AI and machine learning algorithms to predict allergic reactions based on user history and symptoms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Swift:</strong> Primary programming language for iOS app development.</li>
    <li><strong>Xcode:</strong> Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for coding and testing.</li>
    <li><strong>UIKit:</strong> Framework for designing the app's user interface.</li>
    <li><strong>Core Data:</strong> Used for local data storage.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase (future):</strong> For real-time data synchronization and backend services.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Development Journey</h2>

<p>Developed during a block seminar, challenges included learning macOS platform and Swift programming, implementing real-time chat functionality and data persistence, and planning for future scalability with database integration and AI features.</p>
